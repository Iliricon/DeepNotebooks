# DeepNotebooks
DeepNotebooks is an automated statistical analysis tool build on top of SPNs. 
They are currently being developed by Claas Völcker at the ML group at TU 
Darmstadt under the supervision of Alejandro Molina and Kristian Kersting.

## Core idea and vision
DeepNotebooks are a tool to automatically analyze your datasets using 
powerful graphical models for inference. They are build to provide fast 
access to your data and summarize relevant statistical information directly
without fine tuning. Due to their structure, they also expose the underlying 
models for a deeper analysis.

## SPFlow
SPFlow is the underling inference library powering the DeepNotebooks. It is 
developed at the ML group in Darmstadt.
